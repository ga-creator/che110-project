                <p>The technological boom since the age of industrial revolution has seen a massive jump in the energy requirements for humanity. It's simple to present arguments to go back to primitive methods and give up on all materialistic pleasures, but implementing such an act for 8 billion people is an impossible feat. 
                    Rather than cursing our past errors, we should rather focus on what we can do for the future of the planet. One of the major steps could be usage of green energy as opposed to the traditional coal and oil based energy solutions. Developing sustainable solutions to meet the energy requirements will not only be sustainable but rather more efficient from a developmental point of view. Use of solar, wind and hydro energy are some of the options at hand. In the year 2022, green energy only made up to 5.5% of the total energy production globally. This percentage has been increasing by only 0.4% every year. China, USA and India have emerged as the leaders in this contribution with China producing half of the global percentage. India claims to reach 500 gigawatts of energy by the year 2030. Expanding the global use of green energy is imperative to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and reduce dependence on finite, pollution-intensive resources. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources, however, is not without its challenges. Renewable energy technologies, while cleaner, often face higher initial setup costs, geographical limitations, and intermittency issues. For instance, solar energy production requires substantial sunlight, which isnâ€™t evenly distributed across all regions, and wind energy is effective only in areas with consistent wind flow.

                <p>Precision agriculture is transforming traditional farming by integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to optimise resource usage and improve crop yields. One of the leaders in this transformation is John Deere, a global agricultural machinery manufacturer that has implemented IoT solutions to support farmers with data-driven insights. Through IoT-enabled devices, sensors are deployed across fields to collect real-time data on soil moisture, nutrient levels, temperature, and crop health. This data is then transmitted to a central platform, allowing farmers to monitor crop conditions remotely via their smartphones or computers. Drones and GPS-enabled tractors are also used to assist in tasks like soil analysis, planting, and monitoring pest populations. The IoT-based approach helps farmers make precise, data-informed decisions. For instance, with soil moisture sensors, farmers can target irrigation efforts, conserving water and reducing costs. Similarly, nutrient sensors help ensure fertilisers are applied only where needed, minimising waste and reducing environmental impact. With IoT solutions, farmers have seen an increase in crop yield, better resource management, and reduced operational costs. John Deere reports that farms using their IoT technology experience up to a 20% increase in productivity, along with significant savings on water and fertiliser usage. The adoption of IoT in smart farming demonstrates the potential of technology to create sustainable agricultural practices. By allowing real-time monitoring and control, IoT enables farmers to maximise productivity while minimising environmental impact, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable food production systems.
