    <main>
        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) enables devices and systems to connect, share data, and automate processes, leading to increased energy efficiency. By using IoT in homes, industries, and cities, we can monitor and control energy use more effectively, reducing overall consumption and costs.</p>
        <p>For example, smart thermostats can adjust heating and cooling based on occupancy, and sensors in manufacturing plants can minimize equipment downtime and optimize energy usage.</p>
