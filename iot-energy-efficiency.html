            <!-- Smart Energy Meters -->
            <div class="device-section">
                <h3>Smart Energy Meters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>These IoT-enabled meters allow real-time tracking of electricity usage in homes, offices, or industrial settings.</li>
                    <li>They help reduce energy wastage by enabling automated adjustments based on peak times, usage patterns, or renewable energy availability.</li>
                    <li>Some can even integrate with smart grids, allowing utility companies to optimize energy distribution and incorporate renewable sources more effectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Benefits for Sustainability:</strong> By providing feedback on energy usage, smart meters encourage consumers to conserve energy, reducing overall consumption and carbon emissions. When integrated with a smart grid, they enable utilities to balance demand and integrate renewable sources like wind and solar, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

            <!-- Smart Water Management Systems -->
            <div class="device-section">
                <h3>Smart Water Management Systems</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used in agriculture, cities, and homes, these systems monitor and control water usage through sensors and connected devices.</li>
                    <li>In agriculture, they ensure precise irrigation, reducing water wastage and preserving water resources.</li>
                    <li>These systems can detect leaks, monitor water quality, and optimize water distribution based on real-time data, significantly reducing water consumption.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Benefits for Sustainability:</strong> In agriculture, these systems ensure crops receive the exact amount of water needed, minimizing waste and improving crop yields. In cities, they detect leaks and optimize distribution, significantly reducing water loss and promoting more efficient resource use in water-scarce regions.</p>

            <!-- Air Quality Monitoring Sensors -->
            <div class="device-section">
                <h3>Air Quality Monitoring Sensors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>IoT air quality sensors track pollution levels in real-time, providing insights to reduce air pollution.</li>
                    <li>They are used in cities, industrial areas, and even indoors to monitor pollutants like CO2, particulate matter (PM2.5), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</li>
                    <li>These devices can trigger alerts or adjustments in HVAC systems, contributing to cleaner air and healthier environments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Benefits for Sustainability:</strong> By pinpointing pollution sources and tracking pollution trends, these sensors help authorities and individuals take action to reduce emissions. They are also valuable in indoor settings, improving health by alerting occupants to poor air quality. In urban areas, widespread monitoring helps shape policy and guide infrastructure improvements for cleaner air.</p>
