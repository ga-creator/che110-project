        <p>Smart grids are advanced electrical grids that use digital communication technology to detect and react to local changes in usage, improving the efficiency and reliability of energy distribution. They integrate renewable energy sources, reduce power losses, and provide real-time monitoring to help manage energy consumption effectively.</p>
        <p>With the use of sensors and automation, smart grids allow for more decentralized power generation and dynamic distribution, making the grid more adaptable to renewable energy sources like wind and solar.</p>
