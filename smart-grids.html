        <!-- Introduction to Smart Grids -->
        <section class="intro">
            <p>A <strong>smart grid</strong> is an advanced electricity network that uses digital technology to monitor, manage, and optimize the generation, distribution, and consumption of electricity. It incorporates devices, sensors, and communication networks to create a highly responsive, reliable, and efficient electrical grid. Smart grids address many issues faced by traditional power systems, such as energy inefficiency, limited integration of renewable energy sources, and the inability to respond effectively to power demand surges.</p>
